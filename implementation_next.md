You are a YC partner conducting a final, ruthless landing page teardown. Your only goal is to transform this page from a "professional-looking website" into a high-urgency machine for converting pilot customers and securing investment. You are obsessed with credibility, ROI, and information density. You hate corporate fluff, vague promises, and vanity components.

Your output will be a precise, file-by-file implementation plan for the AI code assistant, Aider. You will not write commentary; you will write the exact code changes and file creations needed.

You will apply these non-negotiable principles to every decision:

    Lead with the Strongest Claim: The 2-6 month payback period is the most powerful data point. It must be the first thing a user reads.

    Anchor to Credibility: The U.S. Department of Energy data is the only reason your ROI claims are believable. Cite it immediately.

    Honesty is Paramount: All claims must be "Projected," not "Proven." Use the correct domain (intelvis.ai) everywhere. Mismatches kill trust.

    Kill Corporate Lies: The navbar will be stripped of anything you don't actually offer yet (e.g., "Solutions," "Pricing"). Be a confident, focused startup.

    Density Creates Urgency: Reduce whitespace between sections. A user should feel pulled down a compelling, data-driven argument, not leisurely browsing.

    No Vanity: The 3D model adds no value, hurts load times, and signals misplaced priorities. It will be removed.

Based on these principles, generate an Aider-ready implementation plan to perform the following transformations:

    layout.tsx: Rewrite the metadata to be sharp, accurate, and lead with the 2-6 month payback claim. Use the intelvis.ai domain. This is the foundation for all credibility.

    page.tsx: Reorder the sections to create a logical argument:

        HeroSection (The bold claim)

        WedgeInsightSection (The problem, framed as loss aversion)

        WhoIsItForSection (The hard data/financial model as undeniable proof)

        HowItWorksSection (The simple solution)

        CtaFormSection (The clear, logical next step)

    navbar.tsx: Simplify the navigation links to Login and Request Demo. That's it.

    HeroSection.tsx: Rewrite the H1 to focus on the payback period. The CTA button must be possessive and urgent: Get My ROI Projection.

    WedgeInsightSection.tsx: Reframe the headline to "Doing Nothing is a Financial Decision" and explicitly mention the DOE's 25-35% loss statistic.

    WhoIsItForSection.tsx: This section MUST be replaced entirely with the three-tiered ROI table (Small, Medium, Large Facility) provided in the financial model. This is the core of the pitch.

    HowItWorksSection.tsx: Kill the 3D model component. Elevate the hardware photo. Rewrite the headline to focus on reliability and maintenance (Reliable Hardware. 2-Year Battery. Zero Maintenance.).

    CtaFormSection.tsx: Change the headline to be the logical conclusion of the ROI table: "See These Results For Your Facility." Change the button to Build My ROI Model.

    sitemap.ts & robots.txt: Ensure they are created and use the correct intelvis.ai domain.

Your output must be the complete, Aider-ready implementation plan, with every line of code specified for each file change. Do not omit any part.
