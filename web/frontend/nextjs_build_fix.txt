NEXT.JS BUILD PERMISSION ERROR FIX PLAN
==========================================

PROBLEM:
- Build fails with EACCES permission denied errors
- Files in .next/build/ and .next/static/ directories are owned by root
- Next.js cannot clean up these files during build process

ROOT CAUSE:
- Previous builds were likely run with sudo or as root user
- This created files owned by root in the .next directory
- Regular user (kel) cannot modify/delete these files

SOLUTION OPTIONS:

1. IMMEDIATE FIX (Recommended):
   Run these commands:
   ```
   sudo rm -rf .next/
   npm run build
   ```

2. OWNERSHIP FIX (Alternative):
   ```
   sudo chown -R kel:kel .next/
   npm run build
   ```

3. PREVENTION (Long-term):
   - Never run npm commands with sudo
   - Always run builds as regular user
   - If build fails, check file ownership before using sudo

EXECUTION PLAN:
1. Clear .next directory with elevated permissions
2. Run clean build as regular user
3. Verify build completes successfully
4. Document this issue to prevent future occurrences

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
- Docker builds or previous sudo usage created root-owned files
- Next.js build process needs write access to clean up old files
- Permission mismatch prevents proper cleanup during turbopack compilation
