# Device Connectivity Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive device connectivity monitoring system that allows ESP32s3 devices to periodically ping the server and provides real-time connectivity status in the frontend dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Changes (`web/backend/routes/devices.js`)

#### New Endpoints Added:
- **POST `/api/devices/ping`**: Receives ping requests from ESP32 devices
  - Accepts MAC address in request body
  - Updates device `updatedAt` timestamp and sets status to `ACTIVE`
  - Returns success response with device ID and status

- **GET `/api/devices/connectivity`**: Returns connectivity status for all user devices
  - Calculates if devices are online based on last ping (within 5 minutes)
  - Returns device ID, MAC, connection status, and last seen timestamp

#### Enhanced Existing Endpoints:
- **GET `/api/devices`**: Now includes connectivity information in response
  - Adds `connectivity` object with `isConnected`, `lastSeen`, `minutesAgo`, and `status` fields
  - Determines online/offline status based on last update timestamp

### 2. ESP32 Firmware Changes (`parent/src/main.cpp`)

#### New Features Added:
- **Ping Functionality**: Added `pingServer()` function that sends periodic ping requests
  - Sends POST request to `/api/devices/ping` endpoint
  - Includes device MAC address in JSON payload
  - Provides detailed logging for debugging

- **Periodic Execution**: Modified `loop()` function to ping server every 60 seconds
  - Uses `millis()` for non-blocking timing
  - Maintains device connectivity status automatically

#### Configuration Changes:
- Added `pingServerName` constant pointing to ping endpoint
- Preserved existing provisioning functionality

### 3. Frontend Dashboard Changes (`web/frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

#### New Visual Indicators:
- **Connectivity Status Icons**: Added WiFi/WiFiOff icons from Lucide React
- **Status Dots**: Green/red circular indicators showing real-time connectivity
- **Dual Status Display**: Shows both device status (ACTIVE/INACTIVE) and connectivity (ONLINE/OFFLINE)

#### Enhanced Device Display:
- Reorganized device cards to show more detailed information
- Added "Last seen X minutes ago" for offline devices
- Real-time status updates every 30 seconds

#### New State Management:
- Added `connectivityData` state to store real-time connectivity info
- Implemented `fetchConnectivity()` function with automatic refresh
- Updates connectivity status after device pairing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Connectivity Logic:
- Devices are considered **ONLINE** if they pinged within the last 5 minutes
- Devices are considered **OFFLINE** if no ping received for more than 5 minutes
- ESP32 devices ping every 60 seconds to maintain ONLINE status

### Database Updates:
- Device `updatedAt` timestamp is updated on each ping
- Device `status` is set to `ACTIVE` when ping is received
- No schema changes required - uses existing Device model

### Security:
- Ping endpoint is publicly accessible (no authentication required)
- Device identification uses MAC address validation
- Existing device pairing security remains intact

## Usage

### For ESP32 Devices:
1. Devices automatically start pinging after WiFi connection
2. Ping frequency: Every 60 seconds
3. Server endpoint: `https://intelvis.ai/api/devices/ping`

### For Users:
1. Dashboard shows real-time connectivity status
2. Green indicators = Device is online and responding
3. Red indicators = Device is offline (no ping for >5 minutes)
4. Automatic refresh every 30 seconds

## Files Modified:
- `web/backend/routes/devices.js` - Added ping and connectivity endpoints
- `parent/src/main.cpp` - Added periodic ping functionality
- `web/frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Enhanced UI with connectivity indicators

## Testing:
- Backend dependencies installed successfully
- All endpoints functional and responding correctly
- Frontend properly displays connectivity status with visual indicators
- ESP32 code compiled and ready for deployment
