# Device Connectivity Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive device connectivity monitoring system that allows ESP32s3 devices to periodically ping the server and provides real-time connectivity status in the frontend dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navbar Logo Update (`web/frontend/components/ui/navbar.tsx`)
- **Logo Redirect**: Logo now always redirects to home page (`/`) for all users
- Previously redirected authenticated users to `/dashboard`, now consistently goes to `/`

### 2. Device Renaming Feature

#### Backend API Changes (`web/backend/routes/devices.js`)
- **PUT `/api/devices/:deviceId`**: New endpoint for updating device aliases
  - Accepts `alias` in request body (max 50 characters)
  - Validates device ownership and permissions
  - Updates device alias in database

### 3. Backend API Changes (`web/backend/routes/devices.js`)

#### New Endpoints Added:
- **POST `/api/devices/ping`**: Receives ping requests from ESP32 devices
  - Accepts MAC address in request body
  - Updates device `updatedAt` timestamp and sets status to `ACTIVE`
  - Returns success response with device ID and status

- **GET `/api/devices/connectivity`**: Returns connectivity status for all user devices
  - Calculates if devices are online based on last ping (within 5 minutes)
  - Returns device ID, MAC, connection status, and last seen timestamp

#### Enhanced Existing Endpoints:
- **GET `/api/devices`**: Now includes connectivity information in response
  - Adds `connectivity` object with `isConnected`, `lastSeen`, `minutesAgo`, and `status` fields
  - Determines online/offline status based on last update timestamp

### 2. ESP32 Firmware Changes (`parent/src/main.cpp`)

#### New Features Added:
- **Ping Functionality**: Added `pingServer()` function that sends periodic ping requests
  - Sends POST request to `/api/devices/ping` endpoint
  - Includes device MAC address in JSON payload
  - Provides detailed logging for debugging

- **Periodic Execution**: Modified `loop()` function to ping server every 60 seconds
  - Uses `millis()` for non-blocking timing
  - Maintains device connectivity status automatically

#### Configuration Changes:
- Added `pingServerName` constant pointing to ping endpoint
- Preserved existing provisioning functionality

#### Frontend Changes (`web/frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Rename UI**: Inline editing with save/cancel buttons
- **Keyboard Support**: Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- **Loading States**: Spinner during rename operation
- **Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript interfaces

### 3. Frontend Dashboard Changes (`web/frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

#### Device Renaming Feature:
- **Inline Editing**: Click edit icon next to device name to rename
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enter to save, Escape to cancel  
- **Real-time Updates**: Device list updates immediately after successful rename
- **Validation**: Empty names prevented, 50 character limit enforced
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading spinner during rename operation

#### Enhanced Type Safety (`web/frontend/types/index.ts`):
- Added `DeviceConnectivity` interface for proper TypeScript support
- Replaced `any` types with proper type definitions

#### New Visual Indicators:
- **Connectivity Status Icons**: Added WiFi/WiFiOff icons from Lucide React
- **Status Dots**: Green/red circular indicators showing real-time connectivity
- **Dual Status Display**: Shows both device status (ACTIVE/INACTIVE) and connectivity (ONLINE/OFFLINE)
- **Edit Icons**: Small edit button next to device names for renaming

#### Enhanced Device Display:
- Reorganized device cards to show more detailed information
- Added "Last seen X minutes ago" for offline devices
- Real-time status updates every 30 seconds
- Inline editing interface for device names

#### New State Management:
- Added `connectivityData` state to store real-time connectivity info
- Added rename state management (`editingDeviceId`, `editingAlias`, `isRenaming`)
- Implemented `fetchConnectivity()` function with automatic refresh
- Updates connectivity status after device pairing
- Proper useCallback and useEffect dependency management

## Technical Implementation Details

### Connectivity Logic:
- Devices are considered **ONLINE** if they pinged within the last 5 minutes
- Devices are considered **OFFLINE** if no ping received for more than 5 minutes
- ESP32 devices ping every 60 seconds to maintain ONLINE status

### Database Updates:
- Device `updatedAt` timestamp is updated on each ping
- Device `status` is set to `ACTIVE` when ping is received
- No schema changes required - uses existing Device model

### Security:
- Ping endpoint is publicly accessible (no authentication required)
- Device identification uses MAC address validation
- Existing device pairing security remains intact

## Usage

### For ESP32 Devices:
1. Devices automatically start pinging after WiFi connection
2. Ping frequency: Every 60 seconds
3. Server endpoint: `https://intelvis.ai/api/devices/ping`

### For Users:
1. Dashboard shows real-time connectivity status
2. Green indicators = Device is online and responding
3. Red indicators = Device is offline (no ping for >5 minutes)
4. Automatic refresh every 30 seconds
5. Click edit icon next to device name to rename devices
6. Logo always redirects to home page

## Files Modified:
- `web/backend/routes/devices.js` - Added ping, connectivity, and device rename endpoints
- `parent/src/main.cpp` - Added periodic ping functionality  
- `web/frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Enhanced UI with connectivity indicators and device renaming
- `web/frontend/components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Updated logo to always redirect to home page
- `web/frontend/types/index.ts` - Added DeviceConnectivity interface for type safety

## Testing:
- Backend dependencies installed successfully
- All endpoints functional and responding correctly
- Frontend properly displays connectivity status with visual indicators
- Device renaming feature implemented with proper validation
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ESP32 code compiled and ready for deployment
